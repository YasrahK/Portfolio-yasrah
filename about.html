                        Growing up, I never knew what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be happy and 
                        wanted world to be a happy place.
                        Sometimes you are not able to do what you really want. I had to give up on my dream
                        of becoming a developer when I was back in Pakistan due to societal pressure.
                        But remember where there is a will, there's a way! and here I am now in Chicago trying to pursue my dreams by taking a fresh start. 
                        <br />
                        <br />Currently I'm working as a sales specialist who loves to program, shop and learn new skills.
                        My passion towards coding lead me to learn it professionally. Honestly,
                        I enjoyed every bit of it. I learnt to make basic landing pages to creating weather app using html, css, java 
                        and react using Open weather API. I always look for new ideas and strongly believes in critical thinking. Like things to be detail-oriented. 
                        Enjoys working in a fast-paced startups and energizing conversations.
